<h1 id="intro">What is a kelpie?</h1>

<p>Kelpie, or water kelpie, is the Scots name given to a shape-shifting water
  spirit inhabiting the lochs and pools of Scotland. It has usually been
  described as appearing as a horse, but is able to adopt human form. Some
  accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves when appearing as a human,
  leading to its association with the Christian idea of Satan as alluded to by
  Robert Burns in his 1786 poem "Address to the Deil".</p>

<p>Almost every sizeable body of water in Scotland has an associated kelpie
  story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to
  the general Germanic neck or nixie and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been
  observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian
  bunyip have been seen as counterparts. The origin of the belief in
  malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices
  once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the
  kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from
  dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome
  strangers.</p>

<p>Kelpies have been portrayed in their various forms in art and literature,
  most recently in two 30-metre (98 ft) high steel sculptures in Falkirk,
  The Kelpies, completed in October 2013.</p>

<h1 id="origins">Origins of the myth</h1>

<p>Folklorist Gary R. Varner has suggested that the origin of the belief in
water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the
human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with
horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia.
Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of
keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent
women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used
to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took
retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention
of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of
children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or
turbulent water.</p>

<p>Historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has hypothesised that the
  kelpie myth might originate with the water spouts that can form over the
  surface of Scottish lochs, giving the impression of a living form as they
  move across the water. Sir Walter Scott alludes to a similar explanation
  in his epic poem The Lady of the Lake (1810), which contains the lines</p>

<p><i>He watched the wheeling eddies boil,<br />
Till from their foam his dazzled eyes<br />
Beheld the River Demon rise:</i></p>

<p>in which Scott uses "River Demon" to denote a "kelpy". Scott may also
  have hinted at an alternative rational explanation by naming a treacherous
  area of quicksand "Kelpie's Flow" in his novel The Bride of Lammermoor
  (1818).</p>

<h1 id="sightings">Tales and sightings</h1>
<p>A common Scottish folk tale is that of the kelpie and the ten children.
  Having lured nine children onto its back, it chases after the tenth. The
  child strokes its nose and his finger becomes stuck fast. He manages to cut
  off his finger and escapes. The other nine children are dragged into the
  water, never to be seen again.</p>

  <p>There are many similar tales of water horses in mythology. In Orkney
    there is the nuggle, in Shetland the shoopiltee and in the Isle of Man,
    the ‘Cabbyl-ushtey’. In Welsh folklore there are tales of the ‘Ceffyl Dŵr’.
    And in Scotland there is another water horse, the ‘Each-uisge’, which
    lurks in lochs and is reputed to be even more vicious than the kelpie.</p>
