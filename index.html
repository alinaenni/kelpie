The myth of the kelpie

<div id="content">

<p>Kelpie, or water kelpie, is the Scots name given to a shape-shifting water
  spirit inhabiting the lochs and pools of Scotland. It has usually been
  described as appearing as a horse, but is able to adopt human form. Some
  accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves when appearing as a human,
  leading to its association with the Christian idea of Satan as alluded to by
  Robert Burns in his 1786 poem "Address to the Deil".</p>

<p>Almost every sizeable body of water in Scotland has an associated kelpie story,
but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the
general Germanic neck or nixie and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been
observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip
have been seen as counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water
horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to
appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served
a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water,
and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.</p>

<p>Kelpies have been portrayed in their various forms in art and literature, most
recently in two 30-metre (98 ft) high steel sculptures in Falkirk, The Kelpies,
completed in October 2013.</p>
